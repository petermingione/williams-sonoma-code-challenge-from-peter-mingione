**Requirements** 
----------------

This app requires a web server to run. The data is in the app.php file at the root level. I did not use the original .json api  because  the ajax function was giving me a "Cross-Origin Request Blocked error". Adding the data to the local environment solver this issue.

**Features**  
------------
* The app is responsive.  
* The slide show changes the alt image in the overlay every seven seconds.  
* The slides can be changed manually by clicking on the left or right arrows, or on one of the circles at the bottom of the image, or on one of the thumbnails in the left side menu.  
* The left side menu can be scrolled with the mouse, or track pad, or the up or down arrows.  
* The current slide has its image in the thumbnail menu highlighted. The circle representing the image is also highlighted.
